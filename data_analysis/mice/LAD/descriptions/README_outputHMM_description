Description of HMM output files
There are five output files for each sample plus one summary file that aggregates the main results and was used for the following analysis.

For each sample there are detailed output files:
1) <sampleID>.summary contains the information about VAF, asymmetry and prevalence of HMM states
List of columns:
- input file name (sampleID)
- A_N/T_N ratio in the HMMas state 4 for sites with VAF > 0.25
- A_N/T_N ratio in the HMMas state 4 for sites with VAF < 0.15 (Numbers should be very close with previos column if nothing funny is going on)
- Median VAF autosomes
- Median VAF X chromosome
- Number of sites in HMMas state 0
- Number of sites in HMMas state 1
- Number of sites in HMMas state 2
- Number of sites in HMMas state 3
- Number of sites in HMMas state 4
- Number of sites in HMMmulti state 0
- Number of sites in HMMmulti state 1
- Number of sites in HMMmulti state 2
**** Word "site" means segregating position in HMMmulti and A>N/T>N mutations in HMMas)

2) <sampleID>.ASHMM contains attribution of each A>N/T>N mutation to one of five HMMas states (A0 ... A4)
3) <sampleID>.PloidyHMM contains attribution of each multiallelic site to one of three HMMmulti states (A0 ... A2); 
   *Pleae note that multiallelic sites requere derived allele to have >= 3 reads
4) <sampleID>.bwASEM contains emission probabilities for A>N vs T>N mutations across five states of HMMas
5) <sampleID>.bwPlEM contains emission probabilities for Biallelic vs Multi allelic sites across 3 states of HMMmulti

"HMM_summary.txt" file contains aggregated information across all 455 analyzed tumors and was used for the following steps of analysis.
It merges all columns from <sampleID>.summary + first column from <sampleID>.bwPlEM + first column from <sampleID>.bwASEM
