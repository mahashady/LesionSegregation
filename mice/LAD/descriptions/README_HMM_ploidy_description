Description of HMM_subclone output files

For each sample there are dethreetailed output files:
1) <sampleID>.hmm.BW contains emissions and number of sites for each of the three WC asymmetry state separately for clonal and subclonal mutations.

2) <sampleID>.hmm.Clonesize contains:
   - median vaf value for subclonal and clonal mutations
   - max vaf value for subclonal mutations, minimum vaf value for clonal mutations
   - number of mutations attributed to clonal and subclonal group

3) <sampleID>.CloneAS contains number of sites attributed to each combination of WC asymmetry states between clonal and subclonal mutations.

The aggregated file "Summary_subclone.tsv" contains information about perfomance of fiting of vaf distribution as a mixture of two normal distributions
and classification of tumor as symmetric/diploid/tetraploid.
Summary file columns:
- sample name
- fitting of the vaf distribution ("1_clone" if the algorithm was not able to fit vaf distribution as a mixture of two, 
                                    "bad" if HMM asymmetry emissions lay outside of the expected values)
- tumor classification
